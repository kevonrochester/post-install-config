In this tutorial we will show the core differences between "Admin Panel" and the "Agent Panel" and how to set things up

First since we are using a virtual machine for this turtorial . We will go to Portal.azure.com > create a resourse group > Virtual machines > copy the i.p address > use remote desktop ( or a mac equilant ) to sign into the desktop that we created with the credentials we set up for the virtual machine.

We will login to osTicket with (http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php and login with whatever your Credientials you created for the username and password.

Now that we are login This is what the Agent Panel interface looks like. Also you can see that you can click Admin Panel in the top right corner so you also know that you are in the "Agent Panel"

This is what the "Admin Panel" interface looks like similar as the Agent Panel you can see in the top right that it says Agent Panel so you know you are in the "Admin Panel". Also the "Admin Panel" has a lot more tabs for creative control.
